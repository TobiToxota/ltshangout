# ltshangout 
### Final Project for CS50 Web Programming with Python and JS
This is my Final Project for this course: https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/

### What ltshangout is all about:
ltshangout is a planner for your next nightout with your friends. Here you can find a date, suggest some nice plans and then vote on your plans. Finally you all have planned a nice nightout together

### What do I want to learn with this project:
First things first: I want to improve my Python and JS Skills. But to also learn something new, I am going to build an Django-Rest-Framework as a backend and I want to build the Frontend with my first React Application.

### What do I want to implement/ What have I allready finished;half-finished
- [x] Use JASON Web Tokens for the authentication
- [x] Use Bulma as a CSS Framework
- [ ] Use Anime.js for nice animations in the app
- [ ] Use DiceBear Avatars for Profile Pictures. The Avatars can be changed even in the style
- [ ] Create a UserPage where Users can change their Avatar and their Username
- [ ] {1. Stage} Create the date finder (which supports up to 6 dates) 
- [ ] {2. Stage} Create the NightOut Planning stage. Users can suggest (if they want) a plan (locations and time).
- [ ] {3. Stage} Create the Voting Stage. Users can now vote on the plans
- [ ] {4. Stage} Final Stage: All users will be presented with the final plan (:
